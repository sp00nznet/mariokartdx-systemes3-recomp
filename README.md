# mariokartdx-systemes3-recomp

**Mario Kart Arcade GP DX (Namco / Nintendo, 2013) — a System ES3 kart racer,
statically recompiled from its Win32 executable to native C.**

A cabinet with a wheel, a camera in the roof that photographs you and puts your
face on your kart, a card reader that remembers you, and a network that no
longer answers. Underneath all of that it is a Visual Studio 2010 application
running on a desktop PC, which is exactly the kind of thing a static
recompiler should be good at.

Built on [**systemes3recomp**](https://github.com/sp00nznet/systemes3recomp),
the Namco System ES3 recompilation toolkit, vendored here as a git submodule.

> **No game data here.** No executable, no `Data\`, no DLLs, no certificates.
> The `.gitignore` refuses all of it. Bring a game tree you can already read;
> the recompiled C is output you generate.

## Why this target

Not because it is easy — it is the first ES3 title anyone has taken apart — but
because it is the one with a control group. Four separate builds exist,
spanning 2013 to 2022, and a change that works against one and not another is a
change that was fitted to a binary rather than to the platform. See
[docs/versions.md](docs/versions.md).

| | |
|---|---|
| Target build | **v1.00.32**, the 2013 Japanese release — the smallest and the only unmodified one of the four |
| PE parsing | **Works** on all four builds |
| Functions recovered | **28,597** — the binary is stripped, so these are recovered by recursive descent, not read. 6 discovery rounds, 9,255,442 instructions, **99.5%** of the 4,308,348-byte code range |
| Functions lifted | **28,596 / 28,596**, into 2,126,309 lines of C across 72 translation units. Not one failed outright |
| Instruction coverage | **99.9737%** — 560 lines are `/* TODO */ abort()` |
| Compiles | **Yes** — the largest translation unit builds to a clean 70 MB object with MSVC, no warnings |
| Imports | **495**, of which **489** have a derived stack purge and **455** are answered by the host's own DLLs |
| Board imports | **40** — the OKAO Vision camera, entirely by ordinal |
| Boots | **As far as the entry point.** The image maps at `0x00400000`, all 495 IAT slots are patched, and control reaches `0x007CB996`. Not yet run against the full lifted image |
| Plays | No. The board needs bodies, and nothing is guessed |

### The hard part is not the CPU

It is worth being clear about where the work actually is, because it is not
where a console recomp's is.

The host **is** the machine. A System ES3 is an Intel desktop running Windows;
this is x86-32 code that wants kernel32 and Direct3D, and the computer you
build on has both. `systemes3recomp` forwards the import call to the real
function — `CreateFileW` is answered by `CreateFileW` — so roughly 455 of the
495 imports need no work at all.

What is left is the cabinet:

| | imports | |
|---|---:|---|
| `eOkao*.dll` ×5 | 40 | OMRON OKAO Vision — the camera in the roof. Face detection, facial parts, age and gender estimation. Imported **purely by ordinal**, documented nowhere, and the DLLs exist nowhere but in a game tree. |
| JVS I/O | via `DeviceIoControl` | Coins, wheel, pedals, item button, service and test. The `v1.06.35` build reaches it through `JVSEmuMK.dll!engate` instead, which is the clearest look at the interface we have. |
| `bngrw.dll` | 11 (v1.18+) | The Bandai Namco card reader. Progress, licence and kart to a magnetic card. |
| `Nbam_QR_Code.dll` | 6 (v1.18+) | The QR code printed on that card. Pure computation — the easiest of these. |
| AMCUS / Mucha | — | Network authentication, over stock WinHTTP to servers that are gone. Forwarded, and it fails the way an unplugged cabinet failed. |

**None of these are stubbed**, and that is deliberate. A handler that returns 0
lets the game past the call and breaks it somewhere else an hour later; a
handler that aborts naming itself is the to-do list in the order the game wants
it. See [systemes3recomp's docs/board-io.md](https://github.com/sp00nznet/systemes3recomp/blob/main/docs/board-io.md).

### What it cost the toolkit to get here

This is the first game anyone has put through pcrecomp's whole PC pipeline, and
every one of these was found by running it rather than by reading it. All fixed
[upstream](https://github.com/sp00nznet/pcrecomp), where they help every
PC-era target at once:

| what | found how |
|---|---|
| Function extents were not clamped to the next function, so 28,597 functions claimed **89.5 MB of bodies out of 4.3 MB of code** and lifted to 1.9 GB of C | the output was too big to compile |
| A body cut mid-function *returned* instead of transferring — skipping a `ret` that never ran and leaving esp four bytes low | reading the emitted C for a clamped function |
| `fucompp` and `fucomp` were **81% of every instruction the lifter could not express**, because only the ordered `fcom` forms were listed | counting the `abort()` lines |
| `repz ret`, `jmp fword ptr` and `fld tbyte` each ended the whole run with a traceback | the first three attempts at a full lift |
| The host executable's own image base is `0x00400000` — exactly where the game wants to be | the first attempt to run it |
| Moving the host is not enough: the loader fills that range before any user code can reserve it | the second attempt |
| An import's identity is (DLL, name), not the name — eOkaoDt and eOkaoGn both import `ordinal_302` and they are different functions | the runtime reported 27 board imports where there are 40 |

### The camera is why the toolchain changed

A nice illustration of what an arcade target does to a PC toolkit. Every
import shim has to pop exactly what the real function popped, and the counts
are derived rather than typed — from the Windows SDK's import libraries, from
a `_Name@16` decoration, from a C++ mangling. All of those read the count off
a **name**.

OKAO Vision has no names. It exports by ordinal, there is no import library for
it anywhere on earth, and its DLLs ship only inside the game. 40 imports, no
answer, 40 aborts.

So [pcrecomp](https://github.com/sp00nznet/pcrecomp) learned to read the count
out of the callee: find the export, walk it to its first `ret N`, and there it
is. Checked against the SDK import libraries over every export where both have
an answer — **1,307 agree, 2 disagree** — and on this game's import table it
took the resolved count from **449 of 495 to 489 of 495**.

### The graphics are two APIs at once

The same binary imports from **both** `d3d9.dll` and `d3d10.dll`, plus
`d3dx9_43` and `d3dx10_43`, and picks at run time. Both get forwarded to the
host's real DirectX; which one the cabinet actually took is a measurement
nobody has made yet.

## Reproducing it

```powershell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/sp00nznet/mariokartdx-systemes3-recomp
cd mariokartdx-systemes3-recomp\systemes3recomp

# what the game asks the board for
py -3.11 -m tools pe path\to\MK_AGP3_FINAL.exe

# recover its functions. Half an hour on this binary, and you do it once -
# every later step reads the catalog.
py -3.11 -m tools scan path\to\MK_AGP3_FINAL.exe ..\catalog.json

# lift it - minutes, and 199 MB of C comes out
py -3.11 -m tools recomp path\to\MK_AGP3_FINAL.exe ..\catalog.json ^
                         ..\games\mariokartdx\generated

# build - 32-bit and MSVC, and the CMake will not let you forget either
cd ..
cmake -S . -B build -A Win32
cmake --build build --config Release
.\build\Release\mariokartdx.exe path\to\MK_AGP3_FINAL.exe
```

Run it from the game tree's own directory: the game opens `Data\` and
`DataGlobal\` by relative path.

The first run looks like this, and is meant to:

```
[hle] 455 imports forwarded to the host's own DLLs, 40 not found
      The ones left are the cabinet: JVS I/O, the card reader, the
      camera, the authentication. See docs/board-io.md.
[board] eOkaoAg.dll  unimplemented  <- OMRON OKAO Vision - age estimation
[board] eOkaoCo.dll  unimplemented  <- OMRON OKAO Vision - common
[board] eOkaoDt.dll  unimplemented  <- OMRON OKAO Vision - face detection
[board] eOkaoGn.dll  unimplemented  <- OMRON OKAO Vision - gender estimation
[board] eOkaoPt.dll  unimplemented  <- OMRON OKAO Vision - facial parts
[host] entering MK_AGP3_FINAL.exe at 0x007cb996 (image at 0x00400000)
```

It then aborts on the first thing it wants that the host cannot answer, naming
it and the DLL it came from. That is the whole work plan, in the order the game
wants it.
